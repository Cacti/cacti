# Cacti — Contributor notes for AI coding assistants

This file is for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini,
etc.) working against this repository.  It is also a concise reference for any
human contributor who wants to know the house conventions at a glance.

## Do not commit

The following directories are local developer tooling state.  They are in
`.gitignore` and **must never appear in a commit**, a diff, a PR, or a push:

- `.claude/` — Claude Code session state, sub-agent worktrees, hook cache
- `.omc/` — oh-my-claudecode orchestration state
- `.worktrees/` — local `git worktree` trees used for parallel experiments
- `notepad.md` — ad-hoc scratch file

If any of these ever show up in `git status` as "Changes not staged for commit"
inside a PR branch, stop and investigate before pushing.  The usual cause is
an agent that staged them explicitly with `git add -f` and it should be backed
out with `git rm --cached`.

## PHP runtime

- `1.2.x` / `feat/*-1.2.x` install on PHP 8.0 or newer (`composer.json` asks
  for `>=8.0`) and are tested from 8.1 up.  Write for 8.1 and do not drop
  below it.  PHP 8.0 syntax such as `str_contains`, `match` and the nullsafe
  operator is available; features that arrived in 8.1, such as enums,
  `readonly` properties and `never`, are not, because `composer.json` still
  admits 8.0.
- `develop` requires PHP 8.1 (`"php": "^8.1"`), so 8.1 features are fine there.
- `1.2.x` is a point-release branch.  Prefer the construct already used around
  the code you are editing over a newer equivalent, and keep a syntax change
  out of a bug fix.  That is a review-noise argument, not a compatibility one.

## Cacti idioms

Use the house wrappers instead of raw equivalents:

| Prefer | Avoid |
|---|---|
| `cacti_sizeof($x)` | `count($x)` / `sizeof($x)` |
| `cacti_count($x)` | same |
| `html_escape($s)` / `htmle($s)` | `htmlspecialchars($s)` |
| `html_escape_request_var('k')` / `htmlerv('k')` | manual escape of `$_REQUEST['k']` |
| `get_filter_request_var('id')` / `gfrv('id')` | `(int) $_REQUEST['id']` |
| `get_request_var('k')` / `grv('k')` | `$_REQUEST['k']` |
| `get_nfilter_request_var('k')` / `gnrv('k')` | unfiltered `$_REQUEST['k']` |
| `is_request_var_set('k')` / `isrv('k')` | `isset($_REQUEST['k'])` |
| `CACTI_SERVER_OS` | `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` / platform sniffing |
| `CACTI_PATH_BASE` (develop) / `$config['base_path']` (1.2.x) | hardcoded repo paths |
| `db_fetch_cell_prepared(...)` | string-interpolated SQL |
| `db_qstr_rlike($s)` | manual `'RLIKE ' . db_qstr(...)` |
| `cacti_escapeshellarg($s)` | `escapeshellarg($s)` |
| `cacti_escapeshellcmd($s)` | `escapeshellcmd($s)` |

## Style

- Match the file you are editing.  No drive-by reformat.
- Don't rewrite `api_aggregate.php`, `lib/aggregate.php`, or any other
  file you are not explicitly touching.  Multiple past PRs have been rejected
  because an AI assistant "tidied" unrelated code.
- Tabs for indentation.
- One blank line after a function closing brace.
- PHP-CS-Fixer runs on commit via pre-commit hook.  Install it:
  `composer run-script phpcsfixit` locally before pushing.
- Long lines in `locales/po/*.po` are intentional.  Do not rewrap at 80 cols.

## Security

- Never `include`/`require` a path that came from request data without routing
  it through `validate_path_within` or `validate_relative_path_within`.
- Never compose a shell command by string concatenation.  Use `cacti_exec()`,
  `cacti_exec_string()`, or per-arg `cacti_escapeshellarg()`.
- Never compose an LDAP filter by string concatenation.  Use
  `cacti_ldap_filter($template, $vars)`.
- Every `ORDER BY` clause that references a request value must pass through
  `cacti_validate_sort_column($col, $allowed, $default)` with an explicit
  per-page allowlist.
- Every `RLIKE` clause must use `db_qstr_rlike($s)`; do not build RLIKE
  strings manually.
- Every HTTP fetch of an outbound URL must go through `cacti_http()` (which
  forces TLS peer verification, disables redirects, and optionally enforces
  a host allowlist).

## Commit messages

- Conventional Commits format: `fix(area): short description`,
  `feat(area): ...`, `security(area): ...`.
- One commit = one intent.  Do not bundle style, test, and security fixes in a
  single commit.
- Do **not** list every bullet point you can think of in the commit body.
  Human commits on this repo use 1-3 body lines max.  Anything with 9
  bulleted "fixes" in one commit reads as AI-generated.
- No trailing `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` line.  Cacti does not use DCO
  attribution for AI assistants.
- Match the existing style of `git log --oneline -30` before writing your
  message.

## PR hygiene

- One clear purpose per PR.  If you are tempted to say "while I was in there I
  also fixed …", that is a separate PR.
- Do not include `include/vendor/**` in a PR diff unless the PR is an
  intentional dependency bump.  If vendor files appear, they came from a
  dirty `composer install` or a stale worktree; back them out with
  `git checkout upstream/develop -- include/vendor/`.
- Rebase cleanly before pushing.  Force-pushes are fine with
  `--force-with-lease`; never use bare `--force`.
- Respond to review comments with one sentence.  Long justifications read as
  AI output.

## Common failure modes (avoid)

1. Branch contains `.claude/`, `.omc/`, `.worktrees/` — see top of this file.
2. Branch contains `include/vendor/**` edits — stale `composer install` leaked
   into the diff; run `git checkout upstream/develop -- include/vendor/` and
   re-push.
3. Commit touches `lib/api_aggregate.php` or `lib/aggregate.php` when the PR
   title does not mention aggregates — an assistant rewrote it by mistake.
4. `str_contains(` appears on a 1.2.x branch — not PHP 7.4 compatible.
5. PR description has "Summary / Test plan / Impact" headers with bullets — a
   dead giveaway of AI authorship.  Write a short paragraph instead.
6. 9 commits pushed within 30 seconds — pace commits, or squash them before
   the first push.

## What lives where

- `lib/functions.php` — core helpers (escaping, redaction, session, path)
- `lib/auth.php` — session and lockout logic; `cacti_authorize_resource`,
  `cacti_authorize_has_realm` live here
- `lib/database.php` — `db_qstr`, `db_qstr_like`, `db_qstr_rlike`
- `lib/ldap.php` — LDAP helpers; `cacti_ldap_filter` at the bottom
- `lib/import.php` — package import; the path-traversal hardening lives here
- `lib/html_utility.php` — `validate_redirect_url`, `get_order_string`
- `lib/html_form.php` — form rendering (careful: tooltips render HTML by
  design on some fields, see maintainer feedback on #7054)
