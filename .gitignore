#
# For any folder that ignores all subcontent (<folder>/**), you
# must MANUALLY use 'git add' to include a file as source
# controlled.  This is to prevent addition of local specific
# content bleeding into cacti's main sources.
#
# Example
# -------
# The themes and scripts folders ignore all contents
# beneath them unless that content was already source controlled
# so to add a new theme, or script, make sure to use 'git add'
# before commiting changes.
#
# Themes
# ------
# Themes have a special case where a theme folder that is
# included in a cacti release has all content considered as
# maintainable and as such are prefixed with an exclamation
# mark (!include/theme/mytheme = do not ignore mytheme)
