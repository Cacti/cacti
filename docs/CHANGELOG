-feature: Cacti will use PHP's builtin SNMP support if detected, SNMP is overall faster now too. NOTE: PHP's SNMP support may not work with all of your MIB names, you may have to use the OID instead!

-feature: Added a 'Base Value' field to the graphs to adjust how the vertical axis is displayed.
-feature: Updated the menu/header graphics for a smoother look and easier navigation.
-feature: cacti now stores its settings in the database instead of config.php, so they can be manipulated under 'cacti Settings'. Database credentials are still located in config.php however.
