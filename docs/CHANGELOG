-feature: Each user has a default graph policy: ALLOW or DENY for their graph permissions.

-feature: The default install/upgrade screen has been revised.

0.6.6
-feature: Multiple data sources per .rrd is supported. To use this feature, simply create a data input source with multiple outputs that 'Update RRA'.
-feature: Graph item grouping, which enables you to delete/reorder groups of similair graph items.
-feature: Graph preview and output preview in the console, which allows you to preview what a graph will look like/what rrdtool's output is.

0.6.5
-bug: Fixed some of the data source naming issues. You can now use any data source name you want; cacti will take care of making the name "rrdtool friendly".
-feature: Cacti will use PHP's builtin SNMP support if detected, SNMP is overall faster now too. NOTE: PHP's SNMP support may not work with all of your MIB names, you may have to use the OID instead!
-feature: Basic high speed counter support has been added, use 'hcin'/'hcout' to use it. Also may not work with PHP's builtin SNMP support yet.

0.6.4
-bug: You can now add the same CDEF to multiple data sources in the same graph.
-feature: Ability to "sync" changes with the .rrd file with rrdtool's TUNE function. Cacti also tries to fill in internal data source path and name information to keep graphs from "breaking" when possible.

-feature: Cacti can now export static images/html files when it gathers data like MRTG did.
-feature: Multiple graph hierarchies are supported.

-feature: Added a 'Base Value' field to the graphs to adjust how the vertical axis is displayed.
-feature: Updated the menu/header graphics for a smoother look and easier navigation.
-feature: cacti now stores its settings in the database instead of config.php, so they can be manipulated under 'cacti Settings'. Database credentials are still located in config.php however.
