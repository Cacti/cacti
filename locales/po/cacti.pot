When the Remote Data Collector is <b>'offline'</b>, the Remote Data Collectors Web Site will contain much less information.

The second thing you can do is allocate more memory to memory tables.  We have arbitrarily chosen a recommended value of 10%% of system memory, but if you are using SSD disk drives, or have a smaller system, you may ignore this recommendation or choose a different storage engine.
